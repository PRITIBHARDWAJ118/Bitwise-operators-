# Bitwise-operators
## Aim: To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.
## Theory:
Bitwise operators in C++ perform operations on individual bits of integer data types.
Bitwise operators in C++ perform operations on individual bits of integer data types. They are commonly used in low-level programming, such as manipulating flags, performing bit masking, and optimizing arithmetic operations.

### Bitwise Operators:

1. **AND (`&`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers; result bit is `1` if both bits are `1`, otherwise `0`.

2. **OR (`|`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers; result bit is `1` if at least one bit is `1`.
  
3. **XOR (`^`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers; result bit is `1` if bits are different, otherwise `0`.
   
4. **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of a number (bitwise complement).
  
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, filling with zeros.
   
6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
   ```cpp
  

### Applications:
- **Bitwise AND** is used in bit masking.
- **Bitwise OR** is used to set specific bits.
- **Bitwise XOR** is used to toggle bits.
- **Bitwise NOT** is used for bitwise inversion.
- **Shift operators** are used for efficient multiplication or division by powers of 2.
These operators enable precise and efficient control over individual bits within an integer.
#### incluse<bitset>:
In C++, #include <bitset> allows you to use the bitset class, which represents a fixed-size sequence of bits (binary digits). It's useful for manipulating individual bits in a compact and efficient way.
#### cout<<boolaplha: 
cout << boolalpha; in C++ is used to format the output of boolean values. When boolalpha is set, true and false are printed as "true" and "false" instead of 1 and 0.

 We leant about Bitwise operators and it's applications.
